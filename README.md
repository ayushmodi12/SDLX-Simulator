# SDLX-Simulator

Developed a simulator for the SDLX processor. The simulator takes the instructions from a file containing a sequence of 32-bit instruction codes and executes the program. The output shall be generated using a memory-mapped IO displayed on the screen.

In this project, we used Python and its libraries, numpy and pandas, to develop a working simulator for the SDLX processor. The simulator we have developed displays and updates the contents of the register file, the memory, and the Program Counter after all the instructions given as input through a file are executed by the SDLX processor.
